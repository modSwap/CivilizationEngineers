machine learning for clockwork trajectory:
	there will be a window of opportunity for more efficient ship processing due to the distance required for a ship to move from the queue to the jump zone after the preceding ship jumps

	the bottleneck is the inconsistency of the Align function, which relies on in-game autopilot sending verification of successful alignment. This time sometimes varies

	The machine learning can take place by keeping track of the average time required to align, and applying that to a timer that can send ships at a consistently controlled speed to the jump point before the preceding ship launches



volume function
	determine volume of a grid relative to a reference block
	offset of reference should be taken into account relative to the center of the volume



phone app
	export small but strategically significant packets of data from a server
	integrate with a custom android/iOS app
	data of interest includes 
		cargo, 
		velocity,
		distances,  
		market data, 
		grid positions, 
		fleet diagnostics,
		ship functionality,
		ship missing blocks,
		firepower/ammunition,
		production parameters,
