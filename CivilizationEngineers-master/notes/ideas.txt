	jungle - no HUD indicators (stealth)
	turrets
	minion combat routine
		commanding ship with no weapons, invincible
		moves back when wave is destroyed to join next wave
		in order to have a reference point of the pushed wave	
	
automated mining
	asteroids have a certain number of drill points where ships may
	attach and automatically have their cargo filled
	the asteroid has a finite quantity of a certain ore, and will 
	regenerate at a certain rate
	
orbital mechanics
	figure out gravity distance
	
human travel max 3 G's, automated robotic travel have no limits
human presence could grant buffs, or just be necessary for micromanagement

phone app to manage operations

server splitting one continuous world
	- one 10km x 10km x 10km area is the hub
	- loading times can be estimated and jump times reflect this
	- seamless transition between sectors
	- sectors cannot be bypassed, this allows for accurate traffic monitoring
	- ships automatically stick to one side of the lane, 

trajectory clockwork
	- time ship movement to minimize wait times
	- move from dock queue circle to approach while ship is undocking
	- function of vector thrust: set timer and apply thrust according to intended vector
	  f=ma, in order to clear a dock, standardized ship mass/available-thrust ratio requires 
	  any activated ship to be able to travel a certain distance within a certain time
		- > 5m/s/s in each direction
	- eventually assign towing ships to take care of this for any ship
	- or, calculate max acceleration and set timer accordingly for each ship to traverse a standard 	  distance out of the hangar, turn dampeners off, and apply a different thrust to clear path of
	  incoming ship. These values could be digested into a function station-side that times when to
	  send out verification messages
	
remote welder repair
	- gets dimensions of ship and scans for damage
	- repairs all exterior ship damage
	- welders can penetrate and repair interior
	- no utility other than aesthetic element
